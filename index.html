                    The facial recognition roll call project is an interesting project in the field of artificial intelligence and image processing. 
                        This project focuses on developing a system that automatically identifies and takes attendance of individuals based on their facial images.

                    In this project, you can learn and apply techniques and technologies such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Face recognition: Uses machine learning models and deep neural networks to identify and classify faces in images.</li>

                        <li>2. Feature extraction: Identify important facial features such as contours, eye points, nose and mouth.</li>

                        <li>3. Comparison and classification: Compare the detected face with a database of known faces to determine whether 
                                the person is registered or not.</li>

                        <li>4. Image processing and preprocessing: Clean and normalize images to enhance recognition performance.</li>
                        
                        <li>5. User Interface: Develop an easy-to-use interface for users to enter data and track attendance.</li>

                    In this project, I work on attendance management. Manage student check-in and check-out times, get student information displayed on the screen...

                    Socialmedia is a project on the website Pinterest. It is a social networking platform that allows users to create, manage, 
                        and share "pin boards" of images, videos, and links from across the internet. This platform is often used to search and store ideas, 
                        creativity, and personal interests.

                    Some basic functions that a Socialmedia project includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. User registration and login.</li>
                        <li>2. Create, edit and delete tables.</li>
                        <li>3. Add, modify and delete items (pins) on the boards.</li>
                        <li>4. Search and browse items by keyword or topic.</li>
                        <li>5. Share items and tables with other users.</li>
                        <li>6. Chat messages</li>
                    </ul>

                    In this project, I work on comment management, login and registration.

                    Hotel management project is a software project designed to help manage a hotel operate efficiently. 
                        This is an important application in the tourism and hospitality industry because it helps optimize management processes, 
                        from booking rooms, managing employees, calculating revenue to interacting with customers.

                    Some important features in hotel management projects include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Reservation management: Support managing room reservations, checking availability and booked rooms.</li>
                        <li>2. Warehouse management: Store information about food and beverage products to serve customer needs.</li>
                        <li>3. Employee management: Monitor employee work schedules, assigned tasks and work performance.</li>
                        <li>4. Payment management: Calculate and manage payment invoices, calculate taxes and service fees.</li>
                        <li>5. Reporting and statistics: Provides reports on revenue, occupancy rate, and other hotel performance indicators.</li>   
                    </ul>

                    In this project, I worked on other settings (changing the hotel's name, phone number, address, time, logo and interface), 
                        and the hotel's revenue and profit statistics.
